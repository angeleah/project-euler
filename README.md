Project Euler Problems
======================
This was an exercise to get me familiar with writing programs in Clojure as I was learning how to work in the language.

Usage:
------
- This exercise was only created to prove itself through testing.  There is nothing that runs besides the specs.  Feel free to read through them and the code.  If you would like to run the specs, this is how you would do so...
- Running the specs:
  + First, you need to make sure that you have a Java version greater than 1.5 ($ java -version to check this).
  + Next you need [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen). The quickest way to that is to use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) if you have that installed.( brew install Leiningen)
  If you do not have Homebrew, follow the instructions on the Leiningen page.
  + Once you have that set up, you can clone the project, cd to the root, and type lein spec.
  + You should see 23 examples and 0 failures.
